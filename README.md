# Scavenger
This app we are aiming for an MVP, a proof of concept for a Scavenger Hunt app.

## Main Features
1. Form to solve riddles
This will just be a simple form, asking a question for them to solve.
With a hint button

Use Case:
A user is asked to look for a certain phrase on a sign.
E.G. When was Warburton founded?
Hint* go to the information sign
When they enter the information, they should be a SUCCESS! thing
If they answer incorrectly show, Sorry, incorrect.

2. Geolocation
A user needs to get to a certain location.
Thoughts: Does the user have to click a "I'm here" button, or should it be automatically?
If they are not there and click the button, it offers a hint.
Use below for easy use.

3. Image recognition
A user needs to find a certain object in their travels, such as a bench or acorn.

OR
https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/ar-image-recognition
I am thinking Viro, as it allows us to upload our own images, like a Logo of the town.

4. Stretch Goal!!!! Add Pokemon go like object to find.
